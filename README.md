## Achive mobile app

Achive is a mobile application built with React native, firebase, and JavaScript that is used to socialize and create groups and had a variety of features to help users connect and interact with each other. It contains a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily create and manage their own groups, invite other users to join their groups, and participate in group discussions and activities. The application uses firebase to store and manage user data, such as user profiles and group information, and to provide real-time updates and notifications to users. It also uses JavaScript to add interactive and dynamic elements to the user interface, such as animations and other visual effects. Overall, this type of mobile application would be a useful tool for people who want to connect and socialize with others, and to create and manage their own online communities.

## Project Status

Since this project is not currently in development, its performance and the status of its packages may be compromised. Users may still be able to register, create, join, and leave groups, but some features may not work as expected. The application is still hosted by firebase.

## Reflection

This project was a collaborative effort between me and a startup incubator called Norrinova. The project involved learning about app development and also about startups. The goals of the project included using the technologies I had learned up until that point in my studies, as well as gaining experience with both backend and frontend development. 

Working with a startup incubator like Norrinova was a great way to gain practical experience and learn new skills. Incubators often provide resources, mentorship, and support to help entrepreneurs and startups develop their ideas and grow their businesses. This project may have given me the opportunity to work with other team members, develop my problem-solving and collaboration skills, and learn more about the process of creating and launching a startup. Overall, it was valuable and exciting learning experience.
